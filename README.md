# TeamForge

**Visual Claude Code Sub-Agent Manager for Your Git Projects**

## Description

TeamForge is an open-source tool that simplifies the configuration and management of Claude Code sub-agents in your development projects. Through an intuitive, cross-platform interface, compose your team of specialized AI agents and deploy them directly to your Git repositories.

## Why TeamForge?

Manual configuration of Claude Code sub-agents can be complex and repetitive. TeamForge transforms this task into a visual, guided experience, allowing developers to focus on creation rather than configuration.

## Key Features

- **Cross-platform interface**: Portable application running on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Sub-agent library**: Extensible catalog of predefined agents (backend developers, frontend developers, testers, documentation writers, architects, etc.)
- **Predefined compositions**: Optimized team templates for specific tasks (web development, REST APIs, mobile, microservices, technical documentation, refactoring, etc.)
- **Native Git integration**: Direct connection to your repositories to deploy configurations
- **Customizable configuration**: Adjust each agent according to your specific needs
- **Self-sufficient**: Generated configurations include the sub-agents needed for TeamForge's own development

## Use Cases

- Start a new project with an optimal agent team
- Standardize Claude Code configurations across multiple projects
- Quickly experiment with different team compositions
- Share agent configurations within an organization

## Architecture

TeamForge generates configurations compliant with the official Claude Code sub-agents specification, ensuring full compatibility with the Claude ecosystem.

**Note**: TeamForge is an independent community project, not affiliated with Anthropic. It relies on Claude Code's sub-agent functionality to facilitate their management.
